            </div>This repository contains implementations of Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural networks for abstractive text summarization. We implement Attention mechanism, Teacher Forcing algorithm, and Pointer-Generator Network (inspired by Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks) in our experiment to improve our baseline models. This work was done in collaboration with Henglin Wu, Ruilin Zhao, and Chenyuan Li.
