            </div>This repository contains implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to design and generate new face images of anime characters. A few improvement techniques were implemented to enhance the performance of the Deep Covolutional GANs (DCGANs) as well as the quality of the output. Also included is an implementation of Least Squares GAN (LSGAN) and NVIDIA&rsquo;s open source StyleGAN. StyleGAN and StyleGAN2 are new state-of-the-art GAN architectures developed by a team from NVIDIA.]]></description>
